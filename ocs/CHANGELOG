  - external/java
    - new directory structure:
      - lib: re-usable parts for other java implementations
        - crypto: beginning to port dedis/kyber to java
        - darc: first shot at identity management
        - exception: CothorityExceptions
      - proto: protobuf classes
      - ocs: main classes for onchain-secrets
      - byzgen: common classes for linking ocs to byzgen code
    - most important changes in classes:
      - OnchainSecretsRPC: handles the low-level messaging
      - OnchainSecrets: adds convenience methods to OCS
      - WriteRequest, ReadRequest: represent the data
      - Document: remove encyrption/decryption part
    - put all methods with lowercase-letter first
    - added verification of signature in write-request
      - WriteRequest.getSignature to create automatically a valid write-signature
    - made it possible for multiple darcs to
    co-exist even if they have the same identities
    - cleaning up:
      - Exceptions only use CothorityException
      - tests to use minimal set of darcs
  - conodes
    - error-handling
